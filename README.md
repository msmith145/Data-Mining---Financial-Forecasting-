# Data-Mining---Financial-Forecasting-
We first performed data cleanings on the Dow Jones Industrial Average dataset to remove all the null values from the data and skipped incomplete rows for certain algorithms. Following the cleaning, we performed a number of data reductions depending on the algorithm or desired plot graph of the data. For instance, several plots only used portions of the data for reason such as: saving space and testing the accuracy of forecasting algorithms. We also had one instance of data integration involving the action attribute for the Dow Jones Index dataset. The action attribute did not originally come with the dataset; however, due to the want of developing a decision tree for predicting whether to buy, hold, or sell a particular stock, we researched and added in the approximate values.
